# Timgiasu

## What is it?

Timgiasu is a platform where students can help students teachers knows each other and made appointments for the class with the teachers online or offline.

## Why need it?

- Almost all students in Vietnam go to cram school, supplemental education/lessons or English centers to study after school
  - IZA institute research: ( In terms of students’ study efforts, the proportion of Vietnamese students
    who spend more than four hours per week on out-of-school lessons in all three subjects
    is the highest one among all study countries. Complementary learning inputs are also
    offered at the family level. Vietnamese students engage in 17 hours of extracurricular
    learning activities, the fourth highest rate among countries participating in PISA (after
    Kazakhstan, China-Shanghai, and Russia). This is in line with the well-known
    phenomenon of primary and high school children taking extra classes to supplement to
    in-school instruction in Vietnam. [link](http://ftp.iza.org/dp13066.pdf)
  - 75% Vietnamese parents admit that they let their children go to the extracurricular learning activity - [link](https://thanhnien.vn/giao-duc/gan-75-phu-huynh-cho-con-hoc-them-453775.html)
- Almost the tutor and student meet each other through an acquaintance or the tutor's popularity. They don't know about each other very well from the beginning
